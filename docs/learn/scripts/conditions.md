# Conditions

You can direct algorithms with conditions. They have the same function as other scripting and programming languages.

Defining conditions:
```go
var name = input("Type your name: ");

if name != "" -> {
    print("Hello " + name);
};

#>
OUTPUT

Type your name: <User Input> # Mertcan
Hello Mertcan
-----
Type your name: <User Input> #
<#
```

After the condition is declared with the ``if`` keyword, the function of the condition is defined with the local function.
