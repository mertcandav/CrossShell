``cd``

Allows you to manage the current location. It has the same function as what you know from most shell.

To enter a directory, that directory must be in the directory you are in.

The following command must be processed to enter the directory:
```
cd Documents
```
This command enters the "Documents" directory. The name of the directory you want to enter must be in the "Documents" section.

If you want to go back to the previous directory, that is, if you want to go to the upper directory, you can use ``..``. As:
```
cd ..
```
